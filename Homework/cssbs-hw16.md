1. bits = ~11001100, bits |= (1 << 5), (bits & (1 << 5)) != 0, bits = (11001100 >> 2), bits &= ~(1 << 5)

2. yes, bits = (11001100 >> 2)

3. evaluates an and operation on 1 left shifted index number of times and bits

4. set the index position to 1

5. does an and operation on the index position using 1

6. if bit position n is one set bool true if zero set bool false

7. sets bit position n to 1

8. applies an explicit or operation on bit position bit position n

9. a) no permissions; b) read privilege's; c) write permissions; d) read and write; e) execute permissions; f) execute and read; g) execute and write; f) all permissions

10. each permission is turned on or off via a bit position. If that bit is on the user has that permission otherwise they do not
